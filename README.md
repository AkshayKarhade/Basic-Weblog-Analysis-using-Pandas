# Basic-Bebsite-Log Analysis

This is a basic analysis done of a sample Website log. I tried but wasn't able to find a dataset for website logs so I 
tried to make the sample data myself which is why I am referring to this project as a very easy one. 

The data set:

1: ip_uname_pass_time_stamp.
2: HTTP_req.
3: connection_number: Connection Information.
4: source
5: sys_info

The goal of this project was to write a python script to display only the user details, time stamp and the source of the request.
